Psychological interventions for mental health disorders among university students in Africa: A systematic review and  meta-analysis

## Summary

Mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, and psychosis, constitute a significant global health burden, affecting diverse populations amid rising unemployment, poverty, and limited educational access.

A systematic review and meta-analysis was done to examine the efficacy of psychological in-terventions for mental health disorders among university students in Africa. The meta-analysis was conducted using a Random-Effects Model.

A comprehensive search for scientific publications published in English between 2010 and 2024 in four databases: `Medline (PubMed)`, `Web of Science`, `Scopus`, and `gray literature sources`, yielded articles encompassing a range of intervention types and study designs. 

## Setup

We are assuming you have `R Software`, `Rstudio IDE` and `Python` installed. If not you can download and install [**R software**](https://www.r-project.org/) then followed by [**RStudio/Posit IDE**](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

For installation of Python, you can go through the document `Instructions for installing Python.docx`. You can also use `Google Colab` which is a hosted Jupyter Notebook service that requires no setup to use and provides free access to computing resources, including GPUs and TPUs.

## Data

The data used for analysis and/or generated are available on reasonable request from the [**Study PI - Agnes Kiragga**](mailto:akiragga@aphrc.org?subject=[GitHub]%20Source%20Han%20Sans) and [**Study Program Coordinator - Bylhah Mugotitsa**](mailto:bmugotitsa@aphrc.org?subject=[GitHub]%20Source%20Han%20Sans).

- **Data used for analysis:** `PRT.csv`
- **Meta Data Generated:** `authors_table.xlsx` and `All samples (1).xlsx`. 

## Run

After cloning the repository or downloading the ZIP, you also need the data files (**Data used for analysis** and **Meta Data Generated**) in the _INSPIRE-Mental-Health_Psychological_Interventions_Meta-analysis_ folder.

Open `Rstudio` then set your working directory to the _INSPIRE-Mental-Health_Psychological_Interventions_Meta-analysis_ folder. 

- Open the `Meta analysis.R` script, and run from the beginning.
